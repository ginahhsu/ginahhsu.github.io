          <p id="sum">
            Over the span of three months, our team of four critiqued and redesigned the Young Funds Program (YFP)
            website as the final deliverable for a course. Our objective was to help YFP create a modern and user
            friendly website that would help them achieve their goals of educating young adults on financial literacy.

      <h3>Understand</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/10/your-kids-dont-think-your-money-skills-measure-up.html" target="_blank">
          Approximately 76% of students </a> wish they had gotten help preparing and learning about
          their personal finances in high school. YFP tries to solve this by organizing
          workshops, teaching investing terms, and offering one on one classes
          to prepare students for the investing world. The company itself has many resources
          that are useful for all levels of students wanting to learn more about finances
          but the website itself is messy and hard to find information.
        </p>

        <h3>Define and Update</h3>
        <p>
          To properly solve the pain points for students, we conducted interviews of people with different investing abilities
          and then assessed what they would want from a site like YFP. Using the data we collected, we were able to give personas
          to what general students would want from an investing site. This updated information allowed us to ensure the site was
          targeting all the right points to be able to teach students to their full abilities.Through talking with the target audience of YFP,
          we noticed a few trends that hit all of them. One was the common fear of losing money due to bad calls or lack
          of knowledge. Another was that all of them were looking for affirmation on their investing choices.

        <h3>Audit</h3>
        <p>
          Our course prompt was to take a poorly designed local website to create something more
          appealing and user-friendly for their target audience to use. We chose the
          <a href="https://youngfundsprogram.com/">Young Funds Program</a> website as it has lots
          of great content but was not reaching its audience due to a few
          glaring problems: unorganized content, outdated feel, and navigation problems.
          One of my personal gripes with the website was the autoplaying video so that was
          on my list for the first one to go.

         <br> <br>

         During the interviews, we also got the interviewees to also run through the site and point out the headaches.
         The original website had three main problems: unorganized content, outdated feel, and navigation problems.
         The unorganized content led to low retention rate as students were not able to follow the information given
         and finding additional information was difficult due to the navigation. Students did not want to explore the
         pages and missed out on crucial information that would guide them in their investing journey.

        </p>

        <h3>Information Architecture </h3>
        <p>
          Our first phase was to create a sitemap in order to solve the unorganized
          content and navigation problems of the original site. Using this we would identify the flow of the user
          and highlight important sections. The trends that we found with the interviewees led us to change how the home
          page content was organized as we believed more knowledge could solve a lot of the fears these students had. In
          addition, I wanted to make sure there was a hierarchy to the information so building a mental map of where the
          information was would be easier.
        </p>

        <img class="photo" src="images/YFP/sitemap.png" alt="YFP sitemap" longdesc="#sitemap">

        <div id="sitemap" class="longdesc">
          Homepage main points: clean and easy to navigate with hamburger bar, shows purpose as soon as entering(why it exhists, what it does), sign up for the newsletter.
          About section: shows the team, journey of becoming what it is now, and goals. Has links to the teams linkedin to connect with.
          Content section: combines tips as well as articles for their chapter stories.
          Events section: RSVP to the different events and workshops being led.
          Contact section: Can contact the company for more questions or to hire them for events.
        </div>

        <h3>Low-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
        <p>
          With the flow of the website fixed, we had to tackle the unorganized content on each page. My low-fidelity
          wireframes showcased how we could better lay out each page in order to improve the user experience. By using
          the information we got from our user interviews and our new site map, I would be able to give each page a
          better hierarchy. Here I also began to address the outdated feel of the website and tried to lay things out
          in a more modern manner.
        </p>

      <div class="grid3-short" id="wireframe">
        <img src="images/YFP/WF1T.png" alt="Homepage wireframe" height="100%" width="100%">
        <img src="images/YFP/WF2T.png" alt="Learn page wireframe"  height="100%" width="100%">
        <img src="images/YFP/WF3T.png" alt="Contact page wireframe" height="100%" width="100%">
      </div>
  </div>

  <div class="case">
    <p>From here we came together and chose parts we liked from each wireframe. These, along with modern
      fonts and consistent colours, were combined together to make our medium-fidelity wireframes. We made
      sure that we were still addressing the problems from our original website audit and creating an overall
      user interface that would be more appealing and modern. We also looked into what YFP’s goals were for
      their website in order to showcase their services front and centre.
    </p>

    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Before moving onto our high-fidelity wireframes. We created a few iterations of our medium-fidelity wireframes
       and put them through A/B testing. Doing this, we would ensure that we were creating a more aesthetic and user
       friendly site for YFP’s audience. These wireframes were put through four rounds of testing before we finalized
       them as a base for our high-fidelity. My teammates created our high-fidelity wireframes while myself and another
       teammate were in charge of coding out the final project.

    </div>
    <p></p>


    <h3>Prototype</h3>
    <p>Before diving into the HTML/CSS, we changed a few more things for the final product. The neon green was replaced
       with a more subdued colour in order to not distract from the contact, the navigation bar was simplified by removing
       duplicate social media icons and we increased the padding to separate sections and enhance readability as well as
       hierarchy. My teammate and I split up the pages and we used bootstrap in order to speed up the building progress as
       well as making sure it would be usable on different screen sizes.
    </p>

    <h3> <a class="links" href="https://yfp.netlify.app/index.html">View our final deliverable here!</a></h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Things for the future</h3>
    <p>
      One of the biggest problems that we would run into if this project were to continue would be the aspect of
      mobile design. As we did use some bootstrap, the website was able to adjust to the different screen sizes
      but on mobile it would be a different story. For future sites, mobile first design would be the way to go
      to ensure it would be readable and functional.
