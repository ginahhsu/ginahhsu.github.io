            Stamplet was created as a part of the Airbnb jam x Creative jam hackathon. The prompt was to create a storytelling application
            to help families and/or friends who travel together by allowing them to collaboratively document, organize and share their travel
            experiences.

      <h3>Understand</h3>
      <p>
        This hackathon took place in April during the beginning of the pandemic. The shelter-in-place order had just taken place and people were not able to create
        new travel memories. The Airbnb prompt was to create an application that would be suitable for people of all ages to document their trips. In order to
        accommodate those requirements, we wanted to target the social aspect that was easy to use for all ages. We also wanted to add gamification to the application
        to increase the retention rate and get people going back to it often.
        </p>

        <h3>Diverge</h3>
        <p>
          Looking at the points we wanted to solve, my teammate and I started ideating on our own. We each went on our own for a few hours and created low-fidelity
          wireframes of what we thought would solve the pain points of the challenge. I wanted to make sure that it was easy to use like existing applications but
          also versatile to be compatible with airbnb. I also wanted to implement features where travellers could socialize and post articles of things they found
          interesting, similar to what a facebook group would be like.
        </p>

        <h3>Decide</h3>
        <p>
          My teammate and I came together and started to pick out components of each low-fidelity that we liked.
          We had similar concepts of what we wanted the application to look like and so we chose bits and parts
          from each wireframe that we thought would be the most user-friendly. We also ran through to make sure
          that you could post, view, and plan adventures with friends and family. </p>

        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          We hopped on the collaboration for AdobeXD and began to design out each page. The hackathon lasted for 2 days in
          which we collaboratively worked on the pages, created components, and finalized our design. Throughout these 2 days,
          we would actively call each other to update on the progress as well as aspects of the user experience and design that
          we wanted to improve on.

    <h3>Things for the future</h3>
    <p>
      Hackathons are always so fun to do when you see the final project you created in such a small amount of time. This was my first time using
      components and creating overlays and it was really exciting to see things come together. Next time, I would definitely try to make the user
      experience and interface more intuitive. While I believe that our time constraint made that a harder issue, keeping in mind the functionality
      should be more important than just aesthetics.
