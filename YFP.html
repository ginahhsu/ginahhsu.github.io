          <p id="sum">
            Over the span of three months, our team of four critiqued and redesigned
            the Young Funds Program website as a final deliverable for our course. The
            objective was to help YFP create a modern and more user-friendly website that
            would help them achieve their goals of educating young adults on financial literacy.
          </p>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/10/your-kids-dont-think-your-money-skills-measure-up.html" target="_blank">
          Approximately 76% of students </a> wish they had gotten help preparing and learning about
          their personal finances in high school. YFP tries to solve this by organizing
          workshops, teaching investing terms, and offering one on one classes
          to prepare students for the investing world. The company itself has many resources
          that are useful for all levels of students wanting to learn more about finances
          but the website itself is messy and hard to find information. <br> <br>
          Our course prompt was to take a poorly designed local website to create something more
          appealing and user-friendly for their target audience to use. We chose the
          <a href="https://youngfundsprogram.com/">Young Funds Program</a> website as it has lots
          of great content but was not reaching its audience due to a few
          glaring problems: unorganized content, outdated feel, and navigation problems.
          One of my personal gripes with the website was the autoplaying video so that was
          on my list for the first one to go.
        </p>

        <h3>Target</h3>
        <p>
          In order to properly redesign the YFP website, my teammate researched and
          conducted interviews with students of different investing abilities in order
          to further understand what they would want from a site like YFP. We categorized
          the interviewees into three main categories to breakdown what the audience wanted.

        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <p>
          Through talking with the target audience of YFP, we noticed a few trends that hit all of them. One was the common
          fear of losing money due to bad calls or lack of knowledge. Another was that all of them were looking for affirmation
          on their investing choices. <br> <br>

          Outside of doing research on what the interviewees wanted to see on the website,
          we also got them to run through the site and point out how they would use the site.
          One of the first headaches was that the website was oriented in a way where getting from point A to point B
          was harder than necessary. A lot of the content was unorganized and alongside the
          outdated look of the site, rentention rates were quite low. The interviewees did not want
          to explore the site and missed out on crucial information that would guide them in their investing journey.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 1: Information architecture </h3>
        <p>
          Our first phase was to create a sitemap in order to solve the unorganized
          content and navigation problems of the original site. Using this we would identify the flow of the user
          and highlight important sections. The trends that we found with the interviewees led us to change how the home
          page content was organized as we believed more knowledge could solve a lot of the fears these students had.
        </p>

        <img class="sitemap" src="images/YFP/sitemap.png" alt="YFP sitemap" longdesc="#sitemap">

        <div id="sitemap" class="longdesc">
          Homepage main points: clean and easy to navigate with hamburger bar, shows purpose as soon as entering(why it exhists, what it does), sign up for the newsletter.
          About section: shows the team, journey of becoming what it is now, and goals. Has links to the teams linkedin to connect with.
          Content section: combines tips as well as articles for their chapter stories.
          Events section: RSVP to the different events and workshops being led.
          Contact section: Can contact the company for more questions or to hire them for events.
        </div>

        <h3>Phase 2: Low-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
        <p>
          To start off the design process, each group member made wireframes for what
          we wanted the new website to look like. Since we had our sitemap, I designed the
          navigation accordingly. My goal was to be able to keep the good content that the website offered but organize it in a way
          where the audience could easily navigate the site and find anything they
          wanted. To get rid of the outdated and messy feeling of the original site, consistency
          was key and so I kept a similar feeling throughout the wireframes while maintaining similar fonts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid3" id="wireframe">
        <img src="images/YFP/WF1T.png" alt="Homepage wireframe" height="100%" width="100%">
        <img src="images/YFP/WF2T.png" alt="Learn page wireframe"  height="100%" width="100%">
        <img src="images/YFP/WF3T.png" alt="Contact page wireframe" height="100%" width="100%">
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="case">
    <p>Our team did A/B testing to pick specific elements that would best align
      with the companies goals and convey their content. Four rounds were conducted
      and each wireframe was nitpicked down to font size. These tweaks were added
      to our initial low-fidelity wireframes before proceeding onto high-fidelity wireframes.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 3: High-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
    <p>Using the notes from the low-fidelity wireframes, one of our team members was given the task of designing the high-fidelity
      wireframes. We all communicated frequently to discuss colour schemes, fonts, and images. The high-fidelity wireframes were successful
      in solving the pain points we had discussed during our research.

    <h3>Things for the future</h3>
    <p>
      One of the biggest problems that we would run into if this project were
      to continue would be the aspect of mobile design. As we did use some bootstrap,
      the website was able to adjust to the different screen sizes but on mobile
      it would be a different story. For future sites, mobile first design would
      be the way to go to ensure it would be readable and functional.
