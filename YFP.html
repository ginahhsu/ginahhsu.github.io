        <p id="sum">
          Over the span of three months, our team of four critiqued and redesigned
          the Young Funds Program website as the final deliverable for a course. Our
          objective was to help YFP create a modern and user friendly website that
          would help them achieve their goals of educating young adults on financial literacy.

    <div class="case">
      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <p>
        Approximately 76% of students wish they had gotten help preparing for their personal finances. YFP tries to solve this by organizing workshops, teaching investing terms, and offering one on one classes to prepare students for the investing world.
      </p>

      <h1>Target</h1>
      <p>
        One of my team members conducted interviews with students of different investing abilities in order to further understand what they would want from a site like YFP.
      </p>

      <h1>Findings</h1>
      <p>
        We got the interviewees to run through the site and immediately there were some headaches. The original website had three main problems: unorganized content, outdated feel, and navigation problems. The information on the website was hard to retain due to these problems and finding additional information was difficult due to the navigation. Students did not want to explore the page due to the messy layout and missed out on crucial information that would guide them in their investing journey.
