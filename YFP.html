        <p id="sum">
          Over the span of three months, our team of four critiqued and redesigned
          the Young Funds Program website as the final deliverable for a course. Our
          objective was to help YFP create a modern and user friendly website that
          would help them achieve their goals of educating young adults on financial literacy.

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Approximately 76% of students wish they had gotten help preparing
       for their personal finances. YFP tries to solve this by organizing
        workshops, teaching investing terms, and offering one on one classes
        to prepare students for the investing world.
      </p>

      <h3>Target</h3>
      <p>
        One of my team members conducted interviews with students of different
       investing abilities in order to further understand what they would want
       from a site like YFP.
      </p>

      <h3>Findings</h3>
      <p>
        We got the interviewees to run through the site and immediately there
         were some headaches. The original website had three main problems:
         unorganized content, outdated feel, and navigation problems. The
         information on the website was hard to retain due to these problems
         and finding additional information was difficult due to the navigation.
         Students did not want to explore the page due to the messy layout and
         missed out on crucial information that would guide them in their investing journey.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 1: Information architecture </h3>
      <p>
        Our first phase was to create a sitemap in order to solve the unorganized
        content and navigation problems. Using this we would identify the flow of the user.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 2: Medium-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
      <p>
        Initially, our team each made individual medium-fidelity wireframes to
        solve the pain points of the original website. My goal was to be able to
         keep the good content that the website offered but organize it in a way
         where the audience could easily navigate the site and find anything they
         wanted. I also got rid of the outdated feeling of the original site by keeping
        consistent colour schemes, modern fonts and designs. <br>
        Tweaks were added to our initial low-fidelity wireframes before proceeding
         onto high-fidelity wireframes. These tweaks included changing the order of
          the navigation bar to align with what the audience wanted to see as well
           as what YFPâ€™s goals are.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 3: High-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
      <p>Our team came together with our medium-fidelity wireframes and did A/B testing
       in order to determine what was the best for the company to convey their information.
        Four rounds of testing were conducted and we created the final high-fidelity
       wireframe as a blueprint for our final website.

      <h3>Things for the future</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest problems that we would run into if this project were
        to continue would be the aspect of mobile design. As we did use some bootstrap,
        the website was able to adjust to the different screen sizes but on mobile
        it would be a different story. For future sites, mobile first design would
        be the way to go to ensure it would be readable and functional.
