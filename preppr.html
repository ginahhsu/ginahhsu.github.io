        <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>Time and money are two of the largest barriers to developing healthier eating habits for Canadians who live alone. Taking into account food prep,
             grocery shopping, time to cook, and food wastage can be especially overwhelming.</p>

             were required for the project, I mainly worked as a product designer to navigate through the design thinking of Preppr.

             we turned to Reddit to ask for their relationships with food. With over 100 responses on different threads, we established <a href="https://www.notion.so/User-Personas-87ba30aee02d480b8c2d2da8fba51b49" target="_blank">three user groups</a>.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Our initial goal for usability testing was to figure out whether Preppr was actually solving a problem for people who cook for one. Taking
             an agile approach with our design, we created assumptions based on what we believed users might want. With those in mind, I worked with the
             design team in order to figure out what aspects they wanted to test in addition to our user questions. From there, we found our users and
             started working on the script to be used later on. Even thought the testing was during Covid times, I was lucky enough to test our product in
             person with people who I live with.</p>

        <h4 class="subheading">key findings</h4>
          <p>From our testing, we found that certain functions we assumed would streamline cooking for one actually actually made it more difficult. With
             this in mind, we changed our product requirements list for the next iteration. Visually, our biggest takeaway from from our A/B testing of what
             people wanted to see on their home screen. User wise, we were able to deduce that the product has potential as people agreed with the pain points.</p>

          <p>Being as saturated as the food and drink market is, we had to figure out how we could differenciate our app as well as where our revenue streams would come from.
             Using a business to business (B2B) approach seemed more profitable than a business to consumer (B2C) one so we focused on developing multiple revenue streams through this.
             As we did not have any concrete numbers, I had to make some assumptions based on research I found. To combat this problem, I made a key next to our costs where when one number was changed,
             all of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17L6K1LBEYMmVfeJy_l98mJ27ddwfAf0JgdP_aDzAcbs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">financial statments</a> would reflect the change.</p>

        <p>To ensure financial stability, we not only wanted to work with existing grocery stores but also include features such as our own Preppr points and scraps buddy.

                 find recipes not only based on your ingredients but also on your meal and cuisine.</p>

                <p>From our reseach, we found that most people prefered the standard checklist for grocery shopping. With that information, we decided not use a new style but stick with what people
                   were familiar with. We chose to include standard features like the checkbox crossing off the ingredient but also unique features like sorting by recipe.  </p>

              <p>Meal planning was a key feature of Preppr so we wanted to make sure users had multiple ways to use it. Whether users want to quickly add their favourite meals on the meal plan page or
                 add individual recipes from the browse, using the function will be simple and intergrated. Using popups, the task wouldn't seem too intrusive and users would understand it's a fast interaction. </p>

            <div class="case">
              <p>The previous iteraction, we had also used popups as a way to add the meals. However, the weakest point of this design was how long it would take for users to add their meals.
                 By allowing users to add multiple meals at once, it saves them a lot of time and our auto meal sort system also streamlines the process.</p>

                   can even further curate recipes for the user. Having the inventory can also allow users to get ingredient lifelines to teach how long specifc ingredients are good for. In terms of business,
                   our next steps include implementing our full-fledged loyalty program as well as creating more partnerships,</p>

            <p>One of my biggest learning moments for this project was picking a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for our business and designing to meet that goal. Our original idea was too broad and for our first two interations, we lacked direction.
               Figuring out our that and our North Star Metric (NSM) allowed us to narrow in on all aspects of Preppr and design a product that people would actually want to use. Beyond that, I also learned how to incorporate hueristic evaluations and
               emotional branding in order to create a functional and aesthetic product.</p>
