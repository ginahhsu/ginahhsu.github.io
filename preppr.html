          <p>Time and money are two of the largest barriers to developing healthier eating habits for Canadians who live alone. Taking into account food prep,
             grocery shopping, time to cook, and food wastage can be especially overwhelming.</p></div>

             started working on the script to be used later on. Even though the testing was during the pandemic, I was lucky enough to test our product in

          <p>Being as saturated as the food and drink market is, we had to figure out how we could differentiate our app as well as where our revenue streams would come from.
             Using a business to business approach seemed more profitable than a business to consumer one so we focused on developing multiple revenue streams through this.</p>
             <p>Approaching businesses for actual quotes was outside the scope of this project, so
             financial statements were developed with data from industry research.</p>

                 add individual recipes from the browser, using the function will be simple and integrated. Using popups, the task wouldn't seem too intrusive and users would understand it's a fast interaction. </p>

              <p>In the previous iteration, we had also used pop ups as a way to add the meals. However, the weakest point of this design was how long it would take for users to add their meals.
                 By allowing users to add multiple meals at once, it saves them a lot of time and our auto meal sort system also streamlines the process.</p>

                <p>In the implementation stage, my teammate and I created our design system in order to create cohesive components for our branding. In order to give our application a fun and playful brand,
                   we went with a bright yellow as our primary colour and a burnt orange as our secondary. The mix of photography and graphics icons also creates a lively personality to keep users engaged.</p>

            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
              <div class="callout-large">
                <p>Inventory, ingredient life, loyalty program, partnerships</p>
              </div>
                <p>For the future, Preppr has a few more features to implement. The main one is an easy way for users to implement their current ingredients. Once that feature is implemented, our Scraps buddy
                   can even further curate recipes for the user. Having the inventory can also allow users to get ingredient lifelines to teach how long specific ingredients are good for. In terms of business,
                   our next steps include implementing our full-fledged loyalty program as well as creating more partnerships,</p>

            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <div class="callout-large">
              <p>Holistic design, heuristics, KPIs, emotional branding</p>
            </div>
            <p>One of my biggest learning moments for this project was picking a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for our business and designing Preppr to meet that goal. Our original idea was too broad and for our first two iterations,
               we lacked direction. By figuring out our KPI, we were able to focus on our minimum viable product and improve our key features. Beyond that, I also learned how to incorporate heuristic evaluations and emotional branding
               in order to create a functional and aesthetic product.</p>
