        <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>Time and money are two of the largest barriers to developing healthier eating habits for Canadians who live alone. Taking into account food prep,
             grocery shopping, time to cook, and food wastage can be especially overwhelming.</p>

          <p>This project consistent of three iterations where I was the <a href="#ux">User Experience Researcher</a>, <a href="#bus">Business Analyst</a>, and <a href="#design">Product Designer</a> respectively. While working in these three roles
             were required for the project, I mainly worked as a product designer to navigate through the design thinking of Preppr.

             we turned to Reddit to ask for their relationships with food. With over 100 responses on different threads, we established <a href="https://www.notion.so/User-Personas-87ba30aee02d480b8c2d2da8fba51b49" target="_blank">three user groups</a>.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Our initial goal for usability testing was to figure out whether Preppr was actually solving a problem for people who cook for one. Taking
             an agile approach with our design, we created assumptions based on what we believed users might want. With those in mind, I worked with the
             design team in order to figure out what aspects they wanted to test in addition to our user questions. From there, we found our users and
             started working on the script to be used later on. Even thought the testing was during Covid times, I was lucky enough to test our product in
             person with people who I live with.</p>


          <h4 class="subheading">key findings</h4>
            <p>From our testing, we found that certain functions we assumed would streamline cooking for one actually actually made it more difficult. With
               this in mind, we changed our product requirements list for the next iteration. Visually, our biggest takeaway from from our A/B testing of what
               people wanted to see on their home screen. User wise, we were able to deduce that the product has potential as people agreed with the pain points.</p>

        <p>Being as saturated as the food and drink market is, we had to figure out how we could differenciate our app as well as where our revenue streams would come from.
           Using a business to business (B2B) approach seemed more profitable than a business to consumer (B2C) one so we focused on developing multiple revenue streams through this.
           As we did not have any concrete numbers, I had to make some assumptions based on research I found. To combat this problem, I made a key next to our costs where when one number was changed,
           all of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17L6K1LBEYMmVfeJy_l98mJ27ddwfAf0JgdP_aDzAcbs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">financial statments</a> would reflect the change.</p>

        <p>To ensure financial stability, we not only wanted to work with existing grocery stores but also include features such as our own Preppr points and scraps buddy.
           While we do not get any direct revenue from consumers, having these differenciation features and multiple revenue streams can ensure longevity of our product.</p>

                <p>Even up until the third iteration, the flow of our screens were still confusing to our users. To start fresh, the design team created a new flow based on our usability testing

                <p>For many people, finding new recipes is the best part of cooking. For others, it's more trouble than it's worth. It was important for us
                   to give users different outlets to find what they're in the mood for whether it's spontaneous, ingredient driven, or they're just craving a certain dish.</p>

                <p>For many of our users, using their existing ingredients is how they meal prep. Instead of having to individually Google ingredients, we created a fun and interactive method to
                   find recipes not only based on your ingredients but also on your meal and cuisine.</p>

              <p>Previously, our Scraps Buddy lacked personality and so the interaction did not seem fun to use. While having the same technical functionality, the differentiation was not there from
                 existing applications and neither was the customization. By making the process more fun, users will feel more inclined to continue using it, if not only for the functionality.</p>

                <p>To kickstart the ideation process, we used a mindmap to start linking related words and ideas together. Once the blood was flowing, we split off and used a technique called crazy 8s
                   where within 8 minutes, each of us had to come up with as many ideas as we could. Some of the ones I thought of included a myer-briggs style quiz with resources, a reproductive health application, and some sort of social media campaign.
                   However, we had to focus on the big question: <em>is this feasible?</em></p>

                <p>While Medley's characters and diagrams give the website personality, the execution still isn't what we hoped it would be.
                   An appropriate next step for this project would be to allow for more user iteraction with the activities. This would not only make the site more engaging
                   but given the right content, more educational. After that, implementing our map and creating our care pack would increase our value proposition.</p>

            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <div class="callout-large">
              <p>Holistic design, heuristics, KPIs, emotional branding</p>
            </div>
            <p>While I really loved this project and the real world social impact it provided, one of my biggest qualms was the lack of LGBTQ+ members within our group members.
               We did a lot of research in order to overcome this problem but I wish we interview people in the community on top of our survey. That being said, our survey and research
               allowed me to impactfully tell the stories of LGBTQ+ sex. Another element I learned from this project is the importance of logical thinking and adaptability, especially in
               group settings. Knowing when to look at the big picture over focusing on minor details can save a lot of time and energy better spent elsewhere. </p>

            <div class="callout">
               <p>I hope that Medley sparks change in the sex education curriculum or that companies will provide better services to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
