        <p id="sum">
          In the day of age where stress is considered an everyday state of mind.
          My group wanted to cater an application that would not only curve the
          initial feelings of stress before it becomes anxiety but also help
          animals who are in need of adoption. This project was a final deliverable
          for class but also was expanded on with the feedback given.

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        In day to day life, school and work can be a contributing factor for the
        increasing amount of stress one feels. This alongside the usage of phones
        and social media can lead people to find their self worth online,
        transforming stress to anxiety. In America, the number of students that
        consider themselves stressed is highly above the normal level.

      </p>

      <h3>Target</h3>
      <p>
        Our target audience were people in their teens to early 30’s. This age
        range is when many people are either still in school or have not been
        working for too long. This age range also is the most active on social
        media and would likely feel the pressure associated with the platforms.

      </p>

      <h3>Findings</h3>
      <p>
        We created a survey to collect data regarding if people felt stressed and how they dealt with said stress.

      </p>

      <h3>Phase 1: Information architecture </h3>
      <p>
        Our first phase was to create a sitemap in order to solve the unorganized
        content and navigation problems. Using this we would identify the flow of the user.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 2: Medium-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
      <p>
        Initially, our team each made individual medium-fidelity wireframes to
        solve the pain points of the original website. My goal was to be able to
        keep the good content that the website offered but organize it in a way
        where the audience could easily navigate the site and find anything they
        wanted. I also got rid of the outdated feeling of the original site by keeping
        consistent colour schemes, modern fonts and designs. <br>
        Tweaks were added to our initial low-fidelity wireframes before proceeding
        onto high-fidelity wireframes. These tweaks included changing the order of
        the navigation bar to align with what the audience wanted to see as well
        as what YFP’s goals are.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 3: High-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
      <p>Our team came together with our medium-fidelity wireframes and did A/B testing
        in order to determine what was the best for the company to convey their information.
        Four rounds of testing were conducted and we created the final high-fidelity
        wireframe as a blueprint for our final website.

      <p></p>

      <h3>Things for the future</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest problems that we would run into if this project were
        to continue would be the aspect of mobile design. As we did use some bootstrap,
        the website was able to adjust to the different screen sizes but on mobile
        it would be a different story. For future sites, mobile first design would
        be the way to go to ensure it would be readable and functional.
