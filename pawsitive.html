          In the day of age where stress is considered an everyday state of mind.
          My group wanted to cater an application that would not only curve the
          initial feelings of stress before it becomes anxiety but also help
          animals who are in need of adoption. This project was a final deliverable
          for class but also was expanded on with the feedback given.

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      During day to day life, school and work can be a contributing factor for the
      increasing amount of stress one feels. This alongside the usage of phones
      and social media can lead people to find their self worth online,
      transforming stress to anxiety. In America, the number of students that
      consider themselves stressed is highly above the normal level.

    </p>

    <h3>Target</h3>
    <p>
      Our target audience were people in their teens to early 30’s. This age
      range is when many people are either still in school or have not been
      working for too long. This age range also tends to be the most active on social
      media and would likely feel the pressure associated with the platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <p>
      We created a survey to collect data regarding if people felt stressed and how they dealt with said stress.
      The survey recieved over 200 answers and an overwelming amount of people said they felt symptoms
      of stress and anxiety at least once a week. Although our survey recieved responses from our target audience,
      majority of them were in first year of University and that itself could be a contributing factor for our results.
      Nevertheless, we also collected general data on how people would deal with stress and how to approach our concept.

  <div class="case">

    <p>After our general survey, we conducted interviews with eight participants with specific questions. These questions comprised of
      stress related questions (i.e. Describe your feelings when you experience stress?) to pet related questions (i.e. When you experience
      feelings of stress do find yourself spending time with your pet?). The general notes we got from conducting these interviews were:
      <li>People love animals, helps to reduce stress and lighten one’s mood </li>
      <li>Thousands of memes and funny animal videos on the internet and on social media platforms (Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Vine, etc.)</li>
      <li>Studies prove that therapy animals help to reduce mental health disorders significantly </li>
      <br>
      All of our interview findings were pilled and analyzed and futher research was done regarding the scientific aspect of our idea.
      With all of our research done, we tweaked our original idea a bit and continued onto the first phase.

    <h3>Phase 1: Rapid Wireframing </h3>
    <p>
      After analyzing all of our research, we started to brainstorm what we functions we wanted our application to have. As a significant
      amount of people said that they listened to music to destress, we wanted our application to have the option to listen to the user's
      own music while using or they could opt to mix their own relaxing sounds in our music option. Additionally, we wanted the application
      to have a social media feeling in order to draw audience to it.
      In order to get a general idea on what we wanted our application to look like and how we would wanted it to work, we first did some
      rapid wireframing and planned out the information architecture. Lots of sketches were made in order to incorporate all of our ideas.

    <h3>Phase 2: Low-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
    <p>
      After getting a better understanding of what we wanted for the application, we started designing low-fidelity wireframes.
      These wireframes gave a general idea of how the application would function and so went through user testing. Through testing
      we got feedback regarding swiping from profile to profile being somewhat confusing as well as the treat function being confusing.
      This is also the stage where we started thinking about how we would monetize Pawsitive if it were to be developed. At first we
      thought of using ads but after some research we didn't believe that it would be the most effective method.

<div class="case">

  <h3>Phase 3: High-fidelity Wireframing </h3>
  <p>After contemplation we decided that the one of the best methods for our application to get money and users would be to partner
    up with adoption centers. Using this method, adoption centers could give a small fee when putting their pet animals
    on our application and also a percentage cut when animals were adopted from our application. This way, adoption centers could list
    their pets on an alternative platform to reach a wider audience. We also believed that by having a mix of personal profiles and
    sponsored profiles, it would allow the platform to feel personal but could also promote adopting animals instead of buying from animal mills.

  <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
  <p>
    When it comes to creating a good application, user experience is just as important as the user interface. We were able to collect a good amount of data
    in order to help our targeted audience. However, while the idea in theory was good, I believe that we should've created user persona's in order to accurately
    cater the app to our audience. Our survey did collect a lot of good general data but the app lacks a personal touch. In terms of the user interface, the style
    could be updated to look more modern. Having buttons on the screen made it look more clunky and without it, our users would still be able to navigate.
