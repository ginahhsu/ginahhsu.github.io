        <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>Created for the RSA student design competition to tackle the brief “How might we design systems that provide seamless and cost-effective access
           to quality health services for underserved communities?”, Medley addresses the lack of LGBTQ+
           sex education in Canada.</p>
        <div class="callout-large">
          <p>Medley is a website that aims to comprehensively educate youth about inclusive sexual education.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="subheading">my contributions</h4>
          <p>As a project designer for Medley, I collaborated with teammates to create an end-to-end hi-fidelity website mockup.
             Using design and business thinking to navigate through the design sprint methodology, I helped to create the branding, wireframes,
             and prototype for Medley. I also assisted with the usability testing through script writing and conducting interviews.</p>

        <h4>Phase 1: Understand</h4>
          <div class="callout">
            <p><i class="fa fa-commenting" aria-hidden="true"></i> Can I never lose my virginity if I'm gay?</p>
          </div>
            <p>The right to comprehensive sex education is recognized within international human rights treaties, yet even first-world countries like Canada
               lack inclusive sex education. For LGBTQ+ youth, learning sex education through social media and pornography can often feel like the
               only option. Teaching proper sex education can be a proactive way to address and prevent root causes of negative health problems. Still, existing solutions
               like heteronormative-focused school curriculums are not enough. To better understand the problem from business, user, competitor, and technological angles, our
               first step was to research and expand our knowledge base.</p>

        <p> Using the different methodologies above, our whole team was able to better understand and empathize with the problems surrounding LGBTQ+ sex education.
          With all this in mind, we set our goal:</p>

          <p>Providing accessible sexual health services to LGBTQ+ youth in order to increase inclusive education.</p>

        <h4>Phase 2: Define</h4>
        <p>Even with the information we were able to gather on the pain points of LGBTQ+ sex education, the problem was still too broad to be effectively solved. In turn,
          we shifted our attention to establishing focus.</p>
          <h4 class="subheading">target audience</h4>
          <p>Our main focus was to create a product catered towards LGBTQ+ youth aged 15-24. By catering to a younger age group, we hoped to have a bigger social impact through
            education and creating awareness early on.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

          <h4>Phase 3: Diverge</h4>
            <p>To kickstart the ideation process, we used a mindmap to start linking related words and ideas together. Once the blood was flowing, we split off and used a technique called crazy 8s
               where within 8 minutes, each of us had to come up with as many ideas as we could. Some of the ones I thought of included a myer-briggs style quiz with resources, a reproductive health application, and some sort of social media campaign.
               However, we had to focus on the big question: <em>is this feasible?</em></p>
      </div>

      <img width="100%" src="images/projects/medley/mindmap.gif" alt="">

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <div class="case">
        <h4>Phase 4: Decide</h4>
        <p>Using an innovation matrix, we looked at the feasibility of each idea from the crazy 8s activity and specifically at its effectivness in real world situations. Not only
          did we want a unique idea that could solve the brief, we wanted an idea that would make a positive
          impact within the LGBTQ+ community. More importantly, we wanted our product to be useful in teaching LGBTQ+ youth comprehensive
          sex education. My ideas were showcased on the pink sticky notes. Generally they were high on impact but
          only with further refinement would the idea be completely feasibile.</p>

        <h4>Phase 5: Prototype</h4>
          <p>In line with the design sprint format, our group started to formulate plans for the user experience and user interface of our product. However, before partaking
             in any big steps we first wanted to collectively create our branding aesthetic and our website flow. We ended up going with a fun and colourful brand that would focus on interactive
             elements to engage consumers. <b>Fun fact:</b> being a legal studies student, here is when I did research on the legality of our product (i.e. not obstructing obscenity laws).</p>
        <h4 class="subheading">information architecture</h4>
          <p>Hierarchy is important in many senses of UI design but our focus was on the experience of our product. By creating a sitemap, we were able to view what we topics were to be covered
            and ensure they were impactful enough for our target audience.</p>

             implement a couple of features to help increase safety and education in the least intrusive ways possible.</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <h4 class="contribution">feature one</h4>

              While learning how to put a condom on a banana may be sufficient in the governments eyes, we wanted Medley to help phase out the stigmas surrounding sex.
              To facilitate this as well as to make explicit sex education attainable, we created click through diagrams to talk about topics like fingering, coming out, and
              STIs. Using gender neutral terms, we aimed not alienate anyone and help everyone in the LGBTQ+ community feel included.

              Unfortunately, not every loved one supports the LGBTQ+ community. To avoid accidentally outing or miseducating our users, we created age restrictions,
              monitored for medical accuracy, and implemented a quick leave. Leaving the site is literally a click away but we've also allowed for our users to press
              control/command + 'x' to leave as well. Medley aims to educate people in the least obstructive way possible so implementing a quick leave was a must for us.

          </div>
          <p>To make sure that our product was actually helpful to the LGBTQ+ community, we sought out participants who were willing to test out our prototype.
             As this project was created during the pandemic, we gathered feedback virtually through video calls and had our users go through a cognative walkthrough.
             Our main goals for the usability testing was to find out: <li>Was our content useful?</li> <li>Was it captivating?</li> <li>Would you use it?</li></p>

          <h4 class="contribution">takeaways</h4>
          <div class="callout-large">
            <p>HMW make navigating through our site seamless</p>

          <p>While our concept was shining through and the content was well written, we had problems with our usability heuristics and overall branding. The lack
            of branding and the monotone look made the site seem dull while the inconsistent navigation confused our users. Taking a step back and looking at Medley,
            we created a new plan of action to address our products pain points in order to make it more accessible and fun.</p>

                 for our allotted time so we wanted to make the product as polished as possible.</p>

            <h4 class="contribution">previous iteration</h4>
              <p>In our last iteration, we had barely scratched the surface when it came to branding. Although we had our different colours and characters, we weren't making the best
                 use of the space. This time, we tried to use our branding elements in order to divide up the content and break it down into easy to read sections.</p>

                <p>More iteractions, care pack creation, map implementation</p>
              </div>
                <p>While Medley's characters and diagrams give the website personality, the execution still isn't what we hoped it would be.
                   An appropriate next step for this project would be to allow for more user iteraction with the activities. This would not only make the site more engaging
                   but given the right content, more educational. After that, implementing our map and creating our care pack would increase our value proposition.</p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <div class="callout-large">
              <p>User research, storytelling, logical thinking, adaptability</p>
            </div>
            <p>While I really loved this project and the real world social impact it provided, one of my biggest qualms was the lack of LGBTQ+ members within our group members.
               We did a lot of research in order to overcome this problem but I wish we interview people in the community on top of our survey. That being said, our survey and research
               allowed me to impactfully tell the stories of LGBTQ+ sex. Another element I learned from this project is the importance of logical thinking and adaptability, especially in
               group settings. Knowing when to look at the big picture over focusing on minor details can save a lot of time and energy better spent elsewhere. </p>

            <div class="callout">
               <p>I hope that Medley sparks change in the sex education curriculum or that companies will provide better services to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
