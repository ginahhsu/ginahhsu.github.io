          <p>Failing to address the intricacies of LGBTQ+ relationships, young Canadians rely on possibly misinformative online sources for the bulk of their

        <p>Our first step was to research direct and indirect competitors of the industry to better understand the problem.</p>
        <p>For many, school taught sex education is their only reference but factors like conservative ideologies and lack of funding can skew the information being taught. Other methods of learning often include Google, Twitter, and even pornography.</p>

        <section id="users">
        <h4 class="subheading">users</h4>
        <p>While our assumption was that most youth did not receive comprehensive sex education, more information was needed to validate the pain point. Using a survey, we analyzed 75 responses to various questions relating to education, sexuality, and attitudes.
           With our initial assumption confirmed, we moved to learning more about our user with an empathy map.</p>

          <p>In order to ensure the topics covered would be impactful and accessible for our users, we made a sitemap for Medley.

            <p>I really loved this project and the real-world applications it provided but one of my biggest qualms was the lack of LGBTQ+ members within our group members.
               Doing a lot of research helped us overcome this problem but real world experiences provides more empathy and data than surveys.</p>
            <p>Another element I learned from this project is the importance of logical thinking and adaptability, especially in
               group settings. Knowing when to look at the big picture over-focusing on minor details can save a lot of time and energy better spent elsewhere. </p>

               <p>I hope that Medley sparks change in the sex education curriculum or that companies will provide better services to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
